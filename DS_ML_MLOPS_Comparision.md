# Exclusive Activities
	  These activities are primarily the responsibility of one specific role.
	  
	  Data Analysis and Insights: 
	  	Primarily Data Scientists. Extracting meaningful insights from data, storytelling with data, and communicating findings to stakeholders.
	  Model Architecture and Optimization: 
	  	Primarily ML Engineers. Designing complex model architectures, optimizing for speed and accuracy, and handling large-scale models.
	  ML Infrastructure and Pipelines: 
	  	Primarily MLOps Engineers. Building and managing ML platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring systems.
	
# Understanding the Differences
	  While these roles share some overlapping responsibilities, the key differences lie in:
	  	Focus: The primary area of expertise and interest.
	  	Depth of Involvement: The level of detail and complexity involved in the task.
	  	Tools and Technologies: The preferred tools and technologies used to accomplish the task.
	  	For example, while all three roles might be involved in data preparation, a Data Scientist would focus on exploratory analysis and 
	  	feature engineering to extract insights, while an ML Engineer would concentrate on preparing the data for model training and optimization. 
	  	An MLOps Engineer would ensure data quality and consistency for reliable model training and deployment.
